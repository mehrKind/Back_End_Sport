# Fitness Challenge App

## Introduction
Welcome to our Fitness Challenge App! This application is designed for fitness enthusiasts who are new to the gym and aspire to achieve an impressive physique. Leveraging Python-based AI, the app generates a personalized 30-day workout plan.

Each night, users are presented with a challenge, allowing them to track their daily progress. If they successfully complete all challenges, their workout plan continues as scheduled. However, if a user fails to complete a challenge, we engage with them to understand the reasons behind their inability to follow the plan, and subsequently adjust it to better suit their needs.

In the second part of the app, we’ve incorporated an exciting feature reminiscent of the popular game, Subway Surf. As you run, you’ll hear a 3D sound that creates the illusion of a monster chasing you. This thrilling feature is designed to make you run faster and boost your adrenaline levels.

## Front-End
The front-end of our application is written in Vite+React (JavaScript). The styling is a combination of Tailwind and Bootstrap, providing a modern and responsive user interface. Our goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to navigate through the app and track their progress.

## Back-End
The back-end of our application is built with Django and uses the Django Rest Framework for the API. We prioritize security and privacy, ensuring that all user data is handled with utmost care and confidentiality.

## Conclusion
We hope you enjoy using our Fitness Challenge App and find it helpful in achieving your fitness goals. We're always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. Happy training!

Best regards,
